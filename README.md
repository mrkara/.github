_Hello there! I'm a C++ developer and a passionate advocate for free and open-source software (FOSS). For over two decades, I've been contributing to various FOSS projects, with a deep-rooted history in the LibreOffice and GNOME communities._

### My Journey in FOSS

I started my journey in the early 2000s, driven by a belief in the power of community-driven software. My passion for FOSS led me to become a certified LibreOffice developer and a member of the TDF Membership Committee. I've had the privilege of contributing to the core LibreOffice codebase, working on features like document redaction, full-sheet previews, and improved UI/UX. I am also an active member of the GNOME community, where I've served as the coordinator for the Turkish Translation Team.

### Diving into Blockchain

More recently, I've expanded my focus to the exciting world of blockchain technology. As an Open Source Program Manager at MAKE, I am actively involved in the Casper Network ecosystem. My work involves improving developer experience, contributing to documentation, and building tools that empower the Casper community. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of FOSS principles and decentralized technologies.

### What I'm Working On

- **LibreOffice & Collabora Online**: Continuing to contribute to the world's leading open-source office suite.
- **Casper Network**: Building tools and documentation to support the growth of the Casper ecosystem.
- **Community & Education**: Mentoring new developers and creating educational content to share my knowledge.
